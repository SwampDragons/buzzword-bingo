/bbingo/new

	- returns a game ID

/bbingo/<gameid>/join
	- joins the named game ID (returns a session id), and a list of words to
	  be layed out in rectangular grid.  (hint the session id can be a
	  seed for a pRNG that generates the word list, so can always regen the
	  same board.)

	- long polling for new words?, or websocket?

/bbingo/<gameid>/next
	- advances the next word
	- causes the word to be published to all joined sessions

/bbingo/<gameid>/win/<session>
	- claims a win (verified by the server easily)
